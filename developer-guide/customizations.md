# Customizing ELMS:LN

By design, ELMS:LN is intended to be modified with ease by developers and content contributors alike.

## ELMS:LN for OER hubs / open libraries of material

At it's core, ELMS:LN is a powerful CMS with many aspects built on top of Drupal CMS. Between this, HAX content authoring and [OERSchema](http://oerschema.org) wiring in its element output, it can be a powerful engine for creation and distribution of OER materials. An example of ELMS:LN running in this mode can be found here:

## How to do it

* Make all spaces created open to the world by modify permissions for anyone to see spaces \(option is in course setup\)
* Optionally make CIS have an open page / display which communicates where all the spaces are
* Have fun stamping out OER course materials that benefit the world!
