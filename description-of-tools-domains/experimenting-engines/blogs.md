# Blogs \(blogs / blog.elmsln\) {#media}

## What is it {#what-is-it}

A simple blogging / journalling space for students which is separate from the rest of their course experience. A good place to take notes, ideate, as well as tackle none media based assignments.

## What it has

There is a simple writing tool here which was utilized in a course for multiple semesters. It has a timer tool which allows for timed exercises though it is currently unused for the most part. There is nothing wrong with the data model or interactions it was going for, we just haven't had a strong need for it at this time. If that arises again, it will receive a UX make over.
